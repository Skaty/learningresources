## Databases and DBMS

![DB-DBMS Relationship](images/db-dbms-relation.png)

A **database** is a collection of data. While any data in a medium can theoretically be a database (for instance, scribbling on a piece of paper), databases in the context of this guide typically involve data that are organised in some manner.

Programs generally do not access the raw data directly. Instead, a  **database management system (DBMS)** is used, which will handle the storage, retrieval and updating of the data.

Sometimes people use the term database to refer to a DBMS. However, to avoid any confusion, this guide will use these terms as defined above.
